## Privacy Policy for Congress for Android

The Congress app for Android can share information about your use of the app with third parties in three ways:

* When data about Congress is fetched from the [Sunlight Labs Congress API](https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/) or [Pro Publica Congress API](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api), those APIs receive a bit of information in their logs: your phone's IP address (which can change depending on whether you're on a cellular network or WiFi), the fact that it's the Congress app, and what version of Android and the Congress app you are running. This isn't highly identifiable, is required to download any data into the app, and there's no way to opt out.
* Analytics data (for example, what screens you visit and what buttons you tap) is shared with an account in **Google Analytics**, where it is aggregated. IP addresses are [anonymized and truncated](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en). This aggregated data is also accessible to the owner of the account and whoever the owner chooses to share it with. Users can **opt out** of this by accessing the Settings screen from the dropdown menu on the app's home screen.
* Technical data about your phone and the app, if the app crashes and you choose to send technical feedback to the developer. This is completely **opt in** (and hopefully the app will never crash and you'll never have to think about this anyway!).

If you have any questions about this policy, please [open an issue](https://github.com/konklone/congress-android/issues/new) or [send the developer an email](mailto:eric+congress@konklone.com).
